 In this project, it is required to create a Python script to perform intelligent document processing using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). The objective is to automatically process documents, classify them by year, and populate a CSV file with the extracted information.
 1. Image Binarization:
   - Use binarization algorithms in the Python script to enhance the quality of the document images.

2. Content Extraction with OCR:
   - Use Tesseract OCR in the Python script to extract the content from the documents.

3. CSV File Creation:
   - The Python script should create a CSV file named "processed_documents.csv".
   - Define the following columns in the CSV file:
     - ID: Unique identifier for each document.
     - Title: Title of the document.
     - Authors: List of the document's authors.
     - Publication Date: Publication date of the document.
     - Publication Year: Publication year of the document.
     - Link: Link to the original document.
     - Keywords: Keywords associated with the document.

4. CSV File Population:
   - The Python script should automatically populate the CSV file with the extracted information from the documents.

5. Document Classification:
   - The script should classify the documents by year.
